## Architecture

This is a starter kit for Nx with Lowgular and Simple Architecture

It is app-only approach, meaning we create everything in `application` project type

The architecture consists of 3 main parts:

### Model

A Readonly Interface representing data fetched from backend and needed in the `Component`

### Service

Angular Injectable responsible for fetching data from backend.
You can inject `HttpClient` in it
It returns `Model`

### Component

Angular Component responsible for presenting data on a specific route.
You can inject `Service` in it
It uses `Model` to present the data

## Plugin
